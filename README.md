# TipSplit-Calculator-App
An android developed app that assists you in calculating your total dining cost with a selected tip added, and will allow you to split that total evenly for each person dining, specifying the amount owed by each person.

## Details
User inputs are (1) the original bill total, (2) the desired tip percentage, and (3) the number of people to split the total with tip.

Selecting a tip percentage radio button results in the tip amount and total with tip included to be calculated, and their data fields on the UI to be filled in.

After entering the number of people value and tapping the “GO” button, the total per person and “overage” values is be calculated and their data fields on the UI should be filled in.

Pressing the “Clear” button will clear all fields – the Bill Total, Tip Amount, Total with Tip, Number of People, Total per Person, Overage, and any selected radio button is unselected.

A separate landscape layout was created. The app looks and acts consistently when the orientation is changed.

## Example
Below are examples of how the app looks in both orientations:
